**Project Overview**

This project is a real-time Earthquake Detection & Prediction System that leverages big data tools and machine learning to analyze seismic activity. The system collects data directly from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) API and processes it using PySpark, allowing efficient handling of large-scale earthquake datasets.
The project is built to detect patterns in seismic events, provide interactive visualizations, and predict potential future earthquakes based on historical trends and machine learning models. It includes an intuitive dashboard with filters to explore earthquake occurrences by year, magnitude, and more.

**Purpose**

- The primary objective of this project is to:

- Utilize real-time seismic data for meaningful analysis and prediction.

- Demonstrate how big data frameworks like PySpark can handle and process geospatial datasets efficiently.

- Build a system that not only provides visual insights into past earthquakes but also offers predictive capabilities to foresee possible future events.

- Promote the use of open data and data science for disaster preparedness and risk assessment.
